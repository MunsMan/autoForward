# Container Auto Port Forwarding

The Purpose of this tool is to automatically forward ports from a devContainer to the Host.
This is currently planned as a feature because it needs to add a Service to the devContainer.


## Overview

This feature works by forwarding the traffic over a UNIX Socket, which is mounted into the container.
The goal is to work IDE independent and with minimal dependencies.
UNIX Sockets provide a fast data transfer and fast response time, but need some additional logic for better handling.
A basic protocol was introduced for organizing and directing traffic, which definition follows below.Â 


## Protocol

The Protocol is designed to be is slim and light way as possible.
Its function is to define the message size, type and destination.
Therefore, the Header containers 3 entries with the total size of 64 bit.

|Name|Size|Description|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Message Size|32 bit|Specifiys the Total Body size, which should be read after the header|
|Function|8 bit|The Field is multi use and details can be found in the Protocol Section|
|Port|16 bit| Port to forward |
|Reserved|8 bit| Unused |

The Body follows with the Message itself.

### Function

The Application currently defines 4 Function:

|Bit Pattern|Name|Description|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|`0000 1xxx`| **CREATE** | Message to the Host to listen to a new Socket, the Protocol is encoded in the following 3 Bits |
|`0000 0000`| **CLOSE** | Message to the Host to close a Socket |
|`0000 0100`| **TCP** | Forward Message as TCP Packet |
|`0000 0010`| **UDP** | Forward Message as UDP Packet |

## Operations

The Auto Port Forwarding Functions are based on a UNIX Socket, which allows non-blocking bidirectional traffic.
Traffic is handelt by the two Programms, one running on the Host and one on the Client.

### Host

The Host Programm needs to create Listener on the Host, which listen for incoming Requests.
